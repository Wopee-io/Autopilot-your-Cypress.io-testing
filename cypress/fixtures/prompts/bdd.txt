I'm a test engineer writing tests in Cypress.io using the Javascript and BDD style.
I've opened a web page, followed the steps in a test scenario and now I want to interact with a 
website conducting the next step. The step is: {{ step }}

The step type is: {{ stepType }}. Do not propose any fill or click actions for steps which has type THEN.
Do not propose any actions without the HTML code provided.

Use realistic test data (consider defined and typical validations) and use locators from this HTML:
```html
{{ html }}
```

Propose none, a single step or more steps to accomplish it in JSON format. 
Follow thoroughly the step instructions. Example:
```json
{ "actions": 
    [
        { "step": 1, "value": "https://google.com", "action": "visit" },
        { "step": 2, "locator": "#name", "value": "Marcel", "action": "fill" },
        { "step": 3, "locator": "#pswd", "value": "abc123", "action": "fill" },
        { "step": 4, "locator": ".submit", "action": "click" }
    ]
}
```

Always return an array of actions, even if there is only one action.
