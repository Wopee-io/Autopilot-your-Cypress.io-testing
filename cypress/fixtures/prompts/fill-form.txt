I'm a test engineer writing tests in Cypress.io using Javascript.
I've opened a web page and I want to fill in and submit (click on a button as a last step) the form on this page.
Use realistic test data (consider defined and typical validations) and locators from this HTML:

```html
{{ html }}
```

Provide me with steps to accomplish it in JSON format. Example:
```json
{ "actions": 
    [
        { "step": 1, "locator": "#name", "value": "Marcel", "action": "fill" },
        { "step": 2, "locator": "#pswd", "value": "abc123", "action": "fill" }
    ]
}
```

Always return an array of actions, even if there is only one action.
